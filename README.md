# on-chain-portfolio-management-app

> It's a test assignment for the interest of the role for a famous web3 company.

This project is an On-Chain Portfolio Manager designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing cryptocurrencies directly on the blockchain. It allows users to view balances and perform transactions. An extra function I added to this project is searching through Etherscan API.

## Features
- **Search Address**: Users can search any Etheruem address through Etherscan API.
- **View Balances:** Users can see their cryptocurrency balances directly connected via their Metamask wallet.
- **Perform Transactions:** Enables sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.
- **Connect to Wallets:** Supports connections to Ethereum wallets using MetaMask.
- **Responsive UI:** Includes a dynamic layout for easy navigation.

## Project Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
